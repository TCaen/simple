                <p>The best approach for any business is simply to avoid disputes altogether. Unfortunately, disputes almost inevitably arise and when they do, Mr. Matorin works closely with his clients to resolve them, either through discussions and alternative dispute resolution where possible, or by litigation where necessary. Mr. Matorin often represents clients against much larger opponents and draws upon his own large firm experience to go toe to toe with some of the largest law firms in the country.</p>
                <p>Mr. Matorin takes pride in forging close working relationships with his clients to explore their goals and expectations, demystify the legal process, and explore legal strategies. Communication is the key to a successful attorney-client relationship, and Mr. Matorin keeps his clients promptly and fully advised of all developments and encourages them to call or email at any time they have questions or want to talk about the case.</p>
                <p>Over the two decades of his legal career, Mr. Matorin has represented domestic and foreign clients in myriad fields of business with many types of disputes, both common and unusual. These clients include:</p>
